                    My Honours project was a study into the continued potential of Procedural Content 
                    Generation within 2D games. I wanted to take existing PCG techniques and apply 
                    something to them to energise them up for the creation of new type of Dungeon 
                    crawler levels. The idea I came up with was to hybridize existing techniques. 
                    For this I looked through a bunch of different techniques, existing powerful 
                    techniques like Cellular automata and even experimental techniques like using 
                    Markov chains for level creation.

                <p>
                    When it came down to choosing the techniques, I couldn’t look past the obvious 
                    synergy between Cellular automata and Binary Space partitioning. Two techniques 
                    that create levels in very different ways but because of that, there was less 
                    perceived conflicts between the two. To put it simply: “Can I apply a version of the 
                    CA algorithm to create organic cave like structures to a collection of rooms and 
                    corridors created by BSP?” With the goal of producing algorithmically created levels 
                    made up of interconnected caves.

                    When studying the Computer Games Application development course at Abertay, 
                    procedural Content Generation wasn’t heavily covered, instead left for the 
                    Computer Games Technology course which was much more math and physics based in 
                    what it taught, aimed towards those who want to learn Game engine creation as 
                    opposed to just games programming. So, despite not having direct teaching for the 
                    subject I was still eager to dive into Procedural Content Generation as a new 
                    learning experience.
