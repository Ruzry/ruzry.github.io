                   This was a really fun project as i had to create an audio driven game/scene 
                   so i decided to craft a first person audio driven horror game. Where game progression
                   is indicated through audio.
                   
                   All the sound effects and vocal tracks used in the game were created by myself,
                   being created from sounds i had recorded. (for example the stone grinding sound 
                   was made from a branch scratching of wood)


                </p>

                    The background music used was created by a friend of mine "Jack Hulme". 
                    The Dungeon assets were taken from the Unity Assets store. 
                    The Entire Audio programming module was very insightful, learning how music is stored in a digital context.
                    Learning how to manipulate it, altering pitch, amplitude ect which allowed me to create my own sound effects 
                    that captured the exact sound i was attempting to make.
